## Extended Window type

Make your window class inherit from `WinUIEx.WindowEx` instead of `Window` and you get new features like:
 - Set Title in XAML
 - Set custom TitleBar content in XAML
 - Width and Height get/set properties
 - Set TaskBarIcon
 - Several Convenience properties for controlling if the window can be maximized, minimized, resized, should show in task bar and switchers, change presenter,  make Window always on top, etc.
 - Easy shortcuts for showing Message Dialogs
